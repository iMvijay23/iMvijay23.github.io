# About

Hi, I am Vijay Murari a Master's student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University focused in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I asprire to become a computer scientist eventually by persuing a PhD in the domain of ML/NLP.
I have a strong desire to learn new things and get better in the domain. I am drawn to simple things, want to understand things deeply, and like to build useful systems.
These days, I am fascinated by foundation models (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM, DALL-E), models trained on broad data using self-supervision at immense scale, which can then be adapted to various downstream tasks. These models have changed the way how people might interact with AI. How can we better understand how they work and make them more efficient and robust? is one of my research goals.  

# Academic
I'm currently working as a Research Assistant under [Dr. David Yarowsky]([link-to-professor's-page](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yarowsky/)) in the domain of Multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) for building Machine Translation models in the medical field.

This summer, I am excited to join the [Center for Language and Speech Processing]([link-to-center](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/)) as an intern, where I'll be working on cutting-edge research in the same domain. 

## Research Interests

My research interests are wide-ranging and include:

- Multilingual NLP
- Machine Translation
- Cross-lingual Transfer Learning
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- In-context Learning
- Efficient Training of LLMs

# Interest and Hobbies
- Music 
- - I am a avid classical music listener, I listen to a lot of bach, mozart. I like to play video games but couldn't really get time to play.
- Learning about various interesting langugages
- - I have interest in learning about various languages in similarities, languages like tamil, telugu, kannada are so similar obviously because of coming from same family, but though the symbols differ, a lot of the words are pronounces the same and syntactic representation is similar in kannada and telugu. 
- Movies
- - I love watching movies, especially the thriller and Sci-fi genre. ofcourse terminatior will be my all time favourite.
