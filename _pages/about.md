# About Me

I'm Vijay Murari Tiyyala, a Master's student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. My focus is on Machine Learning and NLP. Interested in my work? Check out my [resume](/files/VijayTiyyalaResume.pdf).

In my current research at the Center for Language and Speech Processing, I'm working under Prof. Mark Dredze to improve chatbot interactions in healthcare. Before this, I was involved in creating a multilingual medical concept dictionary with Dr. David Yarowsky. I also worked in Deloitte as a Data Analyst before my masters.

I'm finishing my Master's at Johns Hopkins, where I've been diving into Deep Learning, Advanced NLP, and ML System Design. I did my undergrad in Computer Science at Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College.

When I'm not researching, I enjoy classical music, gaming in moderation, exploring Dravidian languages, and watching sci-fi thrillers like the Terminator series.

This site is where I share insights from my academic journey and thoughts on the latest in NLP.
