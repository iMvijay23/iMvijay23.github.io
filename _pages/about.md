ðŸ“¢ I am actively looking for PhD opportunities starting Fall 2025.
</div>

Hi, I am a Research Assistant at [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://clsp.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mark Dredze](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/). Broadly, my research interests are in NLP and Machine Learning. 

Previously I received my Master's degree in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University in 2023 where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Mark Dredze](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/), [Prof. Daniel Khashabi](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~danielk/), [Prof. David Yarowsky](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yarowsky/). I also frequently collaborated with [Prof. John W. Ayers](https://ayersresearch.org/) on projects related to AI in public health. 

Currently, I am working on and constantly thinking about the following problems:

- **Interpretability**: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
  - Knowledge localization
  - Memorization and Knowledge editing
  - Using the findings from above to build more robust and trustworthy LLMs
- **Data & Reasoning in LLMs**: LLMs are really good at certain difficult tasks while fail to perform well on simple ones. 
  - Using the findings from ***interpretability***, to continually improve the models through interaction and feedback to ***update knowledge*** and ***generalize*** the models to make them better at downstream tasks?
  - Understanding the role of pre-training data{distribution, ordering, etc} and the training process play in developing robust reasoning capabilites
- **Evaluations**: How can we evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in a more comprehensive manner?
  - Faithfulness, Hallucinations


Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in any of the above topics or just want to chat about research!

## Research Experience

### Research Assistant - CLSP, Johns Hopkins University 2023-2024
- Developed methods to enhance LLM fine-tuning and improve empathetic AI responses in healthcare applications.

### Research Intern - CLSP, Johns Hopkins University 2022-2023
- Worked on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and evaluated clinician-AI collaboration frameworks in healthcare.
- Worked on instruction following ability in code LLMs using self-instruct.

### Graduate Research Assistant - CLSP, Johns Hopkins University 2022-2023
- Improved machine translation accuracy for medical terminologies in low-resource languages, enhancing accessibility and precision.


## Projects 

### Empathy-Enhanced LLMs: Refining AI Responses with Fine-Grained Human Feedback
```code 
Designed and fine-tuned models to improve empathy, quality, and factuality in healthcare chatbot responses, ensuring they are both accurate and compassionate.  
```

### SAMOYEDS: Simulating Agents for Modeling Outcomes and Estimations to Direct Social-policy
```code 
Developed a tool using LLMs to simulate public responses to health policies, aiding decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic.
```

### Medical Terminology Translation and Multilingual Matrix Construction
```code 
Created a massive multilingual matrix for medical terms, enhancing machine translation for low-resource languages.
```

### Public Health Data Science
```code 
  Collaborated with [John W. Ayers](https://ayersresearch.org/) on multiple projects to leverage AI & data for public health insights. This included developing models to monitor trends in health behaviors and improve disease forecasting, contributing to impactful public health research.
