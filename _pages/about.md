Hi, I'm Vijay Murari Tiyyala, a researcher in NLP and Machine Learning with a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University. Interested in my work? Check out my [resume](/files/resume/VijayMurariTiyyala_Resume.pdf).

In my full-time research role at the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University, I work under [Prof. Mark Dredze](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/) to enhance chatbot interactions in healthcare. Before this, I developed a multilingual medical concept dictionary with [Dr. David Yarowsky](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yarowsky/). I also have experience as a Data Analyst at Deloitte.

## Projects 

### Empathy-Enhanced LLMs: Refining AI Responses with Fine-Grained Human Feedback
In this project, I led the development of models to improve empathy, quality, factuality, and comprehensiveness in text generation. This involved fine-tuning models, creating innovative training datasets, and developing new algorithms to ensure healthcare chatbots provide responses that are not only accurate and relevant but also empathetic and comprehensive.

### SAMOYEDS: Simulating Agents for Modeling Outcomes and Estimations to Direct Social-policy
Developed a tool using LLMs to simulate public responses to health policies, aiding decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Medical Terminology Translation and Multilingual Matrix Construction
Created a massive multilingual matrix for medical terms, enhancing machine translation for low-resource languages.

### Cannabis Use Detection in Clinical EMR
Trained NLP models to detect cannabis use in EHRs with 97% accuracy, improving data quality and compliance.

### Adverse AI: Automated Discovery of Adverse Event Reports
Led development of a tool to identify adverse events from unstructured text, achieving 97.5% accuracy and reducing manual review time.

### Improving Code Editing through Self-Instruct
Enhanced code editing by fine-tuning code LLMs, streamlining workflows with a 37% pass@1 accuracy.

### Public Health Data Science
I collaborated with [John W. Ayers](https://ayersresearch.org/) on multiple projects to leverage big data for public health insights. This included developing models to monitor trends in health behaviors and improve disease forecasting, contributing to impactful public health research.


## Experience 

### NLP Researcher - Johns Hopkins University (Full-Time)
At Johns Hopkins, I engineered an empathetic medical chatbot using LLaMA3, boosting response accuracy and enhancing patient interaction quality. I also reduced training time by 50% using PyTorch/SLURM in a multi-GPU environment.

### NLP Research Intern - Center for Language and Speech Processing
I developed a RAG chatbot with Apache Solr Cloud, reducing search time by 70% and increasing web traffic by 40%. Additionally, I optimized document retrieval and integrated re-ranking and chunk summarization.

### Graduate Research Assistant - Johns Hopkins University
I improved machine translation accuracy for medical terminologies in low-resource languages, enhancing accessibility and precision.

### Business Technology Analyst - Deloitte
At Deloitte, I developed stored procedures and scripts for integrating clients’ tax data via APIs, reducing processing time and boosting client retention.

## Publications

### Published
- Kreyòl-MT: Building MT for Latin American, Caribbean, and Colonial African Creole Languages, NAACL 2024.

### Under Review
- ANALOBENCH: Benchmarking the Identification of Abstract and Long-context Analogies, submitted to ACL 2024.
